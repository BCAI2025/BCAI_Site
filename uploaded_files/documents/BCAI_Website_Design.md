## BioClarity AI: Website Content Master Document

## Page 1: Home – The Precision Medicine Engine

Core Narrative: Moving from "Trial and Error" to "Digital Certainty."

• Headline: Precision Medicine, Engineered.

- Sub-headline: Bridging the gap between digital simulation and clinical success.
BioClarity AI utilizes high-fidelity generative models to solve the most complex delivery and manufacturing challenges in gene therapy and precision oncology.

- Mission Statement: Traditional drug discovery is a black box. With 93% of radiopharmaceutical candidates failing in preclinical stages and 98% of small molecules unable to cross the blood-brain barrier, the industry needs a new map. We provide the coordinates.

• Hero Metrics:

☐ 1.2B+ Variants Screened In Silico

☐ 95% Prediction Accuracy for Molecular Binding

☐ 3x Acceleration in Discovery Timelines

## Page 2: What We Do – Services & Capabilities

Core Narrative: Standardizing AI adoption across the drug development lifecycle.

## Section A: How We Engage

- AI Incubator: Rapid pilot programs for high-risk targets using proprietary synthetic data.

- Specialized Delivery: Custom-built models for complex modalities (AAV, Bispecifics, and Radioconjugates).

- Adoption Partnership: End-to-end integration of AI into existing R&D loops to harmonize wet-lab and dry-lab data.

## Section B: Capability Bento Grid (The Modular Hub)

- AAV Capsid Engineering: High-throughput design of CNS-specific "GPS" for gene therapy.

- Small Molecule CNS Discovery: Rapid screening of vast chemical spaces for BBB-penetrant compounds.

- Bispecific Antibody Design: Multi-parameter optimization for affinity, stability, and manufacturability.

- Knowledge Systems (Dis2Vec): Our disease-representation foundation model for target identification and repurposing.

## Page 3: Science & Impact – The Evidence Hub

Core Narrative: Proven results across four key scientific pillars.

## Pillar 1: AAV Capsid Design

• The Problem: Natural AAVs lack tissue specificity, leading to liver toxicity.

- The Approach: Screened 1.28 billion variants via in silico evolution using AlphaFoldMultimer and LSTM models.

- Result: Identified 3 novel CNS-specific candidates with a 40% lower predicted immunogenicity risk.

## Pillar 2: Small Molecule Discovery (MSH3 Pilot)

- The Problem: The Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) excludes 98% of neuro-therapeutic candidates.

- The Approach: Virtual screening of 120 million compounds targeting MSH3 (Huntington’s Disease).

- Result: Compressed discovery timelines from months to days, achieving sub-10 nM potency.

## Pillar 3: Bispecific Antibody Discovery

- The Problem: High risk of aggregation and instability in multi-target biologics.

• The Approach: Generative Design Loop utilizing Graph Neural Networks and LLMs.

- Result: Achieved 95% binding efficiency and a 3x reduction in development time for Osteogenesis Imperfecta targets.

## Pillar 4: Virtual Cell Perturbation

• The Problem: Wet-lab target validation is slow and often fails to predict off-target effects.

- The Approach: In silico knockout simulations using the seCPT foundation model.

- Result: Achieved $R^{2} = 0.95$ transcriptomic accuracy, enabling "Go/No-Go" decisions before entering the lab.

## Page 4: The Future – Radioconjugate Theranostics

Core Narrative: Our proprietary IP direction in precision radiation.

• Headline: Pioneering the Next Generation of Precision Oncology.

- Strategic Focus: We are translating our AI expertise into proprietary Linker and Chelator IP.

• Key Future Metrics:

○ 35% Increase in predicted radiolabeling yields.

☐ 40% Reduction in clinical protocol amendments through AI-guided trial design.

☐ 85% Accuracy in real-time clinical trial outcome forecasting.

- Philosophy: Stability in the bloodstream, surgical precision at the tumor. We optimize for the "Short Half-Life" reality of isotopes.
